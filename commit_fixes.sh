üêõ SQLAlchemy Compatibility Fix:
- Remove deprecated checkfirst=True parameter from db.create_all()
- Fixes TypeError in SQLAlchemy 2.x compatibility
- Resolves Gunicorn worker boot failures

‚è±Ô∏è Worker Timeout Prevention:
- Increase Gunicorn timeout from 60s to 300s (5 minutes)
- Add graceful timeout handling
- Prevents worker timeouts during discovery process

üìù Scheduler Context Fix:  
- Fix application context error in scheduler logging
- Add defensive logging with fallback to standard logging
- Prevents 'Working outside of application context' errors

üöÄ Discovery Process Optimization:
- Limit performers per run (max 10) to prevent timeouts
- Limit studios per run (max 5) due to higher scene counts  
- Reduce page limits: 5 pages for performers, 10 for studios
- Add periodic commits during processing to prevent data loss
- Add progress logging for better monitoring

These changes ensure reliable operation without worker timeouts
while maintaining full functionality for content discovery."
